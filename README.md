Simple and lazy invert color script that can be used anywhere. Codes other than scripts/content.js are (partly) from chrome tutorial with some modification. 
This one does not invert background images (cannot get it to work). But invert everything else. The main one is https://github.com/lvsl123/chrome-extension-invert-color-1

This one acts more like a fallback for sites that aren't working with the other one. All source codes are open to the public in case safety is your concern.

All you need to do is download the whole zip file. Unzip and find a folder to put them, and go to chrome://extensions . Choose developer mode on the top right, and choose the folder where the extension is unzipped. Does not work on mobile Chrome

I can't guarantee anything else here and this is not completely bug free. If this one does not work on one page I use the other one above.
